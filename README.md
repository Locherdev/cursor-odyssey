![GameCover](cover.jpg)

## Controls:

*  LEFT MOUSEBUTTON: Choose Menu Option
*  RIGHT MOUSEBUTTON: Pause/Unpause

## Setting:
The reconnaissance spaceship Odyssey is stranded and without fuel!
This circumstance would be a sure death sentence yet there is still hope.

It would seem that your mouse cursor exhibits a mysterious gravitational force
that propels the Odyssey forward. Now it is in the hands of the player to drive
the Odyssey back home while evading the tricks and evils of the vast universe.
